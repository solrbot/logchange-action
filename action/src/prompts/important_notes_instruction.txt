## Important Notes

Consider whether to add an 'important_notes' field to highlight:
- Breaking changes
- Security implications
- Major deprecations
- Migration guidance needed
- Performance impacts
- Database migration requirements

Only include 'important_notes' if the change significantly impacts users or requires attention during upgrades.
